Project 3 fir Mirtha, Sydney and Netsanet

***********************
Brainstorm for Day 1 - 
Pretend we are a patient with a rare medical condition/pre-med student wanting to specialize in something rare. Want to consider proximity to 
hospitals in a given area - what's closest, best ratings, quality of care. 
Hospital data across the US (could narrow to a specific region if are too big) 
We want to look at hospital specializations, locations/proximity to cities, etc. 

* We have CSV files for location data on hospitals from Kaggle: 
has two files iwth coordinates, tons of info, ratings, mortality, trauma level, etc.

* need API and HTML Data ??????
